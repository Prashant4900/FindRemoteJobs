# 🌍 FindRemoteJobs.work

Hey folks 👋

I built [FindRemoteJobs.work](https://findremotejobs.work) to help developers find remote jobs from around the world — quickly and without distractions.

It's a **minimal, no-login, no-clutter job board** focused entirely on remote tech roles. Whether you're actively job hunting or just keeping an eye out, this is built with simplicity and dev experience in mind.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

The idea came from my own experience. Most job boards out there are either too bloated, hard to filter, or filled with mostly on-site listings. I wanted something cleaner — a job board that does one thing well: **list remote jobs for tech folks**.

So I built this for devs like me — and maybe like you.


## ⚡ Features

- ✅ Curated remote jobs for developers, designers, DevOps, data folks, and tech leads  
- 🔍 Super fast, clean UI — no ads, no login walls  
- 📱 Fully responsive and mobile-friendly  
- 📅 Updated regularly with fresh roles  
- 🧑‍💻 Tech-only listings — no unrelated categories
